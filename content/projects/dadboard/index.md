This is a PCB commissioned by [aeonic-dev](https://github.com/aeonic-dev). It's designed for use with either soldered south-facing MX-style switches, or north-facing kailh hotswap sockets. The two halves can be connected with TRRS jacks, and have USB-C. The board can use either an ATMEGA 32U4 AU/MU, and is designed with mousebites to break apart and be produced in once piece.
